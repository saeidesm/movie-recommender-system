 ### Movie Recommender System
* **Dataset:** The TMDB 5000 movie dataset
* Explored and analyzed the dataset
* Clean the datasets and merge all available datasets together.
* Preprocess each column to get the important keywords and put them all together in the "tags" column
* Used the **Bag of Words** technique for the vectorization
* Computed the cosine angle between all vectors(movies)
* Recommended top 6 movies based on the cosine angle(similarity)
* Used Streamlit to visualize the movie recommender as a web application
